## Target Group and Prequiste

The OER module has been created with the aim of assisting participants who seek to explore and improve their skills in working with SDIs, particularly for the purpose of finding and downloading necessary data for windfarm repowering. The module is suitable for both students and professionals. Users are advised to have basic knowledge of GIS. The OER module provides guidance on these technologies and can be utilized to gain some initial practical experience with in working with SDIs and QGIS.

## How to Use OER Module

A Storyboard can be accessed and followed as a guide to implement the OER module tutorial.
