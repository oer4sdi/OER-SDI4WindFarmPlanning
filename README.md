# How Spatial Information Infrastructures Support the Planning of Wind Farms 
(Version 1.0 / August 2024)

In this learning material, we will use the real-world use case of planning the extension of a wind farm in the municipality of Lorup in Lower Saxony, Germany, to explore how geoinformation infrastructures support the availability and use of geospatial data needed in the wind farm planning process.

You will learn,
- why wind farm planning requires easy access to up-to-date, high-quality geospatial data and what kind of data is needed,
- how SIIs facilitate the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of geospatial data that is needed for wind farm planning.
