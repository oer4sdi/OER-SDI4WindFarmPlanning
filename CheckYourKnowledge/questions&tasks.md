   Answers:

      - Bodies: state cabinet
      - Processes: legal acts, tasking the steering committee 
      - Artifacts: laws, decisions
   - **Organizational**
      - Bodies: steering committee, coordination office (organized at LGLN), working groups, and all contributing organizations
      - Processes: concept development, project work, communication & coordination
      - Artifacts: reports, concepts, application profiles of standards, guidance documents, ..
   - **Implementation**
      - Bodies: information broker such as the LGLN, content and service providers such asl 
      - Processes: producing and providing datasets and services, publishing datasets and services via metadata, managing the metadata catalog, providing the GDI-NI geoportal (web site)
      - Artifacts: data, metadata, storage, computing and communication infrastructure, service instances, .. 


**1.2 What is the difference between the geoportal and the metadata catalog of a Spatial Data Infrastructure?** 

Answers:

  The GDI-NI geoportal is the web site that provides comprehensive information on the GDI-NI. The GDI-NI metadata catalog is a back-end component that supports storage and retrieval of metadata. The catalog can be accessed a) by humans via the geoportalâ€™s user interface and b) by machines via its API (e.g. OGC CSW or OGC API records).  

**1.3 What makes a metadata catalog a federated metadata catalog?**

A federated system of metadata catalogs is characterized by the fact that they update each other according to certain rules and thus share metadata with each other. A catalog becomes a member of such a federation, and thus a federated catalog, when it actively or passively participates in such a federation. 
- Active: push metadata to subscribing catalogs
- Passive: respond to pull-requests from requesting catalogs.

For example, GDI-DE actively harvests metadata from all metadata catalogs of the German states. INSPIRE harvests metadata from the national geoportals of the member states. All participating metadata catalogs are federated catalogs.

**1.4 What are the advantages of a web feature service over a simple file download?**
