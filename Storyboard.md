## *1. OER Overview*
The Federal Government in Germany has set itself a target of doubling the amount of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2030. Wind power will play a major role in this. Expanding an existing wind farm is a cost-effective way to increase the energy production. This OER module is focused on harnessing the power of Spatial Data Infrasturture to support wind farm planning.



Understanding the fundamentals of SDIs, performing basic spatial data analysis, and having practical experience using SDIs to expand wind farms are the learning objectives for this course.
Upon completion of this OER module, participants should acquire the necessary skills to:
- find and access geographic data from Spatial Data Infrastructure.
- Review metadata to evaluate the accuracy and currency of data.
- Use GIS Desktop software (QGIS) to manage geographic data and perform spatial analysis.  
- Create maps to visualize potential areas for wind energy farm extension, and interpret the results to make informed decisions.




## *2. Introduction*
The importance of wind energy as a renewable energy source is on the rise. Increasing the share of renewable and clean energy in the global energy mix is essential for achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals such as SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy).
To support the development of wind farm projects it is crucial to work with realiable and updated geographic data.Spatial Information Infrastructure (SII) refers to a framework of geospatial data, technologies, policies, and standards that enable the collection, management, analysis, and dissemination of spatial information. SII is a comprehensive system that facilitates the integration and sharing of geospatial data and related information across different organizations, sectors, and levels of government.

## *3. Scope*

While Germany is one of the leaders in the development of wind energy with goal to allocate 2% of Germany's land area to wind power energy by 2032, the nation faces a number of obstacles and difficulties when constructing or expanding exisiting wind farms, including restrictions on building near protected areas, as well as concerns over noise pollution from wind turbines that can impact the health and well-being of nearby residents and animals.


## *4. Workflows*
A local authority in Lower Saxony has hired you to cooperate with a private investor to identify several potential sites in the state for enlarging and repowering existing wind farms with high-efficiency wind turbines. The selected site must meet several characteristics:

-	Located in the state of Lower Saxony
-	Within 4 km of existing wind farms containing turbines 
-	Within at least 800 m of neighboring houses
-   Does not intersect with any protected site
  
in order to meet these criteria, you need to explore and find the data for administrative boundaries, existing wind farms, buildings, and protected sites. Next, you'll start querying these layers to narrow down locations with the characteristics you want. Finally, you'll combine these into a single layer on which you can conduct a multicriteria analysis to locate a few viable sites.



## *5. Data Search and Download*

Identifying the precise type of data needed for the task is crucial before looking for and downloading geographic data. Finding geographic data is made easier by using Spatial Data Infrastructure. They enable quick and easy access to a variety of data from many sources, saving time and effort while looking for information. Additionally encouraging transparency, interoperability , innovation, and cost-effectiveness.

In this OER module, our focus will be on Lower Saxony,So we will search for SDIs that provide geographic data specific to Lower Saxony.

State Office for Geoinformation and State Surveying Lower Saxony is provide access to geoinformation data that is accurate, up-to-date, complete and compatible with other data from Lower Saxony, Germany and Europe.

  1- Go to [Landesamt f√ºr Geoinformation und Landesvermessung Niedersachsen](https://opengeodata.lgln.niedersachsen.de/) and explore the available data

##  Self Assesment
In this OER module We will focus on wind farm expansion in Lower Saxony.Participants will learn how to leverage spatial data infrastructure. Upon completion of the tutorial, participants will be encouraged to apply the same steps they have learned to expand wind farms in North Rhine Westphalia(NRW).
