# OER SDI4WindFarmPLanning - Teacher's Guide

## 1. Conceptual Aspects of the Learning Material

This tutorial was developed as a supplementary learning material for lectures/exercises in the subject area of spatial data infrastructures and can be used for blended learning. There are no dependencies on specific courses or course content, so it can be integrated as a learning unit in a wide variety of contexts and can also be used for independent learning.

It is an introductory learning module that should help to better understand what SDIs are and how SDIs present themselves in practice.
The chapter "Background" ties in with contents of teaching courses, in which theories and concepts about SDI are taught in more detail. The exercise that follows allows to interact with SDIs and getting familiar with SDI components.

The core of the practical part is the *data acquisition* section. The geoportals of various spatial data infrastructures are used to search for and find the data required for the use case. At this point, the importance of both the quality of metadata and the usability of geoportals becomes evident. In addition, it should become clear that the geoportal's metadata catalogs are interconnected via replication mechanisms. 

The second part serves to complete the use case and to show that the retrieved data is indeed interoperable and of a quality suitable to satisfy the information needs of the use case "wind farm planning". This part is also a small exercise in handling GIS tools (QGIS in this case). The workflows are described in sufficient detail so that even users with little GIS knowledge can understand them and transfer der knowledge to other contexts.

## 2 Recommendations for the use of the learning material

### 2.1 PDF version

The learning material consists of a PDF file that you can download from the /docs subfolder. As supporting materials, you will find the data of the exercise in the /data subfolder and sample solutions for the questions and tasks in the /sampleSolutions folder.

The PDF document can be used as a digital script or as a printout. You can integrate it - like any other digital material - into your learning management system. 


### 2.2 Ways of using the learning material

Of course, students can simply read the material. However, in doing so, they will also overread a lot of things and miss essential insights that only come from hands-on experience with the topic. 

We have designed the learning material to support active engagement with the learning topic and would highly recommend making use of this:

   a) Ask the students to follow the described workflow themselves, i.e., to search for and find the required data in the data portals and to process them themselves in the described GIS analysis. They can compare the result in all sub-steps with the results of the tutorial.

   b) Ask the students to answer the questions in chapter 5. Discuss these and similar questions with the students.

   c) Ask students to complete the task described in Chapter 5. You may also want to modify this task or have them perform similar tasks (e.g., refine the analysis by adding more criteria and data).
Sample solutions to the questions and tasks can be found in the "sampleSolutions" subdirectory in this GitHub repository.

### 2.3 Re-use, modification and distribution of the learning material

We are happy if the learning material is useful for you! You can reuse and distribute the material as-is or in modified form, as it complies with the OER's open [license terms](https://github.com/oer4sdi/OER-WindFarmExtension/edit/main/LICENSE.md).  

We also appreciate constructive feedback and contributions to the learning material: Please add notes on errors and suggestions for improvement as issues to the repository's GitHub issue list. Thanks a lot!
